Welcome to pycnet-audio!

This package is intended to provide a command-line interface and a
useful Python API for processing audio data using PNW-Cnet, a deep
learning model developed for bioacoustics research.

This software requires Python version 3.8 and SoX. We recommend setting
up a dedicated Conda environment for easier dependency management.

Full documentation for this package is hosted by Read The Docs and is 
available at
