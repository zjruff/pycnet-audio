# Welcome to pycnet-audio!

`pycnet-audio` is a Python package which provides a command-line 
interface and a useful Python API for processing audio data using 
PNW-Cnet, a deep learning model developed for bioacoustics research.

This software requires Python version 3.8 and SoX. We recommend setting
up a dedicated Conda environment for easier dependency management.
