# Welcome to pycnet-audio!

`pycnet-audio` is a Python package which provides a command-line 
interface and a useful Python API for processing audio data using 
PNW-Cnet, a deep learning model developed for bioacoustics research.

## Installation

`pycnet-audio` is available from the
[Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pycnet-audio/) and can be
installed using `pip`. However, you will first need to install a compatible 
version of Python (currently only Python 3.8), as well as SoX. For ease of 
use, we recommend setting up a dedicated Conda environment for running 
`pycnet-audio`. We find it is easiest to do so using Miniconda.

[Install Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/), then open the
Anaconda Prompt program and run the following command:

```
conda create -n pycnet -c conda-forge sox python=3.8
```

This will create a new conda environment called `pycnet` with Python version 
3.8 and will install the required `sox` package from the 
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) repository.

Next, activate your environment...

```
conda activate pycnet
``` 

Finally, install the package from PyPI:

```
pip install pycnet-audio
```

This will install the package and its dependencies.
