Welcome to pycnet-audio!
========================
.. admonition:: Version information

	This document is for pycnet-audio version |release| and was generated |today|.

.. contents:: Contents


**pycnet-audio** is a package that provides command-line tools and a Python API for processing bioacoustics data using the PNW-Cnet deep learning model. pycnet-audio is structured as a Python package and contains a main module called ``pycnet`` with several submodules that can be imported and used in Python code to define your own workflows for processing audio data. It also provides command-line tools in the form of console scripts which can be used as-is to execute more standardized workflows. To see the formal package documentation, check the links under Module Reference. For installation instructions, detailed usage notes and tutorials, keep reading.

This guide generally assumes that you are running a 64-bit version of Windows. pycnet-audio is theoretically platform-agnostic, but we have not tested it extensively on GNU/Linux or MacOS systems. Language geared toward users on these platforms may be added in the future.

.. admonition:: Background

	The PNW-Cnet model was developed by the U.S. Forest Service and is used to facilitate passive acoustic monitoring of Northern spotted owls (*Strix occidentalis caurina*; "NSO") and other forest wildlife in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A. The NSO monitoring program is now one of the largest acoustic data collection efforts in the world, generating >2 million hours of recordings annually from >1,000 field sites in Washington, Oregon, and California. PNW-Cnet was first developed in 2018 and has since undergone several major retrainings; the current version, PNW-Cnet v5, detects ca. 75 species of wild birds and mammals found in the Northwest, as well as various forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise.
	
	For more information on the NSO monitoring program, `visit our website <https://www.damonlesmeister.com/>`_.

.. admonition:: A note on naming

	The name **pycnet** is a portmanteau of **Py**\thon and PNW-**Cnet**\, chosen for being short, punchy, and easy to type. The main importable module provided by this package is called pycnet, as is the main command-line tool used to process data, so we initially planned to use pycnet as the name of the distribution package as well. Tragically, this name was already taken on PyPI.org, so to avoid ambiguity, the distribution package is called pycnet-audio. Practically, this means you should use the name **pycnet-audio** when installing or updating the package using pip. For all other purposes, including running the command-line tools as well as using the functions and classes exported by the module in your own code, use **pycnet**.


Installation
============

pycnet-audio can be installed from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ using the ``pip`` tool, which comes bundled with all modern Python distributions. You will need Python version 3.8, and to use the program in full, you will also need to install `SoX <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/>`_. To simplify setup and dependency management, we recommend using a dedicated Conda environment. Conda environments are essentially self-contained Python installations that can be created, configured, and deleted without affecting the operation of other software on your system. They can also be readily "cloned," which makes it straightforward to set up identical environments on multiple machines. 

To set up a Conda environment, you will need to install either Anaconda or Miniconda. We recommend using Miniconda, which is designed to be lightweight and modular, whereas Anaconda is a fairly heavy-duty suite containing a variety of scientific software, most of which is not relevant for our purposes. 

`Install Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_, then use the Anaconda Prompt program to run 
::

	conda create -n pycnet -c conda-forge sox python=3.8

Hit Enter when you are prompted to proceed. This will create a new conda environment called pycnet with Python 3.8 installed and will install SoX to it from the conda-forge repository. (The `conda-forge repository <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ is maintained by the open-source community and, unlike the repositories maintained by Anaconda, Inc., it does not require a license to use.)

If all goes well, you should see a message that looks like this:
::

	Preparing transaction: done
	Verifying transaction: done
	Executing transaction: done
	#
	# To activate this environment, use
	#
	#     $ conda activate pycnet
	#
	# To deactivate an active environment, use
	#
	#     $ conda deactivate

	(base) C:\Users\zjruf>

Note the ``(base)`` at the beginning of the prompt on the last line. This indicates that the ``base`` Conda environment is active. As mentioned in the message above, we can now activate the ``pycnet`` environment by running
::

	conda activate pycnet

The ``(base)`` indicator in the command prompt will change to ``(pycnet)``, indicating that the pycnet environment is now active and we can install things to it. Now run 
::

	pip install pycnet-audio

pip will search the Python Package Index for the **pycnet-audio** package and will automatically install the latest version and its dependencies (and its dependencies' dependencies, etc.) to the pycnet environment. This may take some time and there will be a lot of output in the console, but as long as you don't see the word ``ERROR``, everything is probably working fine.

Once the package has been installed, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running 
::

	test_pycnet

This will run the TestPycnet script, which will create a temporary folder in the current working directory, synthesize a short audio file using SoX, generate a set of spectrograms, process them using the PNW-Cnet model, and extract and verify a set of apparent target class detections. Again, there will be a certain amount of output in the console, most of which can be ignored, although it may be an illustrative example of output from processing data. If everything works as it should, then you will ultimately see a message like this:
::

	################################################################################
	################################ Test complete. ################################


	pycnet appears to be working correctly. Hooray!

	Remove files and folders created for this test? [Y/n]

Hit Enter to delete the temporary test folder, then give yourself a pat on the back. You have successfully installed pycnet-audio!

.. note::

	If you ever want to update pycnet-audio (or any other package), you can do so by running e.g.
	::

		pip install --upgrade pycnet-audio
	
	If the package has a release listed on PyPI.org that's newer than the version you're using, pip will automatically download and install it for you. You can also specify the exact version you want, which doesn't have to be newer than the one currently installed, so this can also be used to "downgrade" a package to an older version. See `pip's documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/>`_ for details.

Using pycnet
============

We have a defined processing workflow for bioacoustics data which consists of a number of distinct steps that are completed in sequence, beginning with a set of audio files that have been retrieved from the field and ending with a set of target species detections that can be analyzed to make ecological inferences. The steps in our workflow are as follows:

1. The files are organized in a directory structure that reflects the field sampling scheme. Each recording station has a folder containing the audio files from that station, and each field site has a folder containing the station folders from that site. Filenames are standardized to include information on where and when each recording was made.
2. Audio files from each field site are inventoried and summarized at the site and station level.
3. A set of spectrograms representing short segments of the audio is generated.
4. The spectrograms are processed and classified using the PNW-Cnet model to produce a set of class scores. Every image has a score for every class included in the model.
5. The class scores are filtered according to a set of review criteria, consisting of a mapping of target classes to score thresholds. In other words, each class (sonotype) that we are interested in has a corresponding score threshold, and the set of `apparent detections` for a given class is the set of clips to which PNW-Cnet assigned a score greater than or equal to the threshold for that class.
6. If necessary, the apparent detections for each class we are interested in are reviewed manually to produce a set of human-confirmed detections, grouped at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale. The amount of review effort can be tailored to project goals and level of interest in each species or class. For instance, some classes might be reviewed in more detail to produce a detection history for each recording station with weekly sampling occasions. Others might only be reviewed enough to confirm the presence of a species at each field site.

pycnet is not designed to encompass every aspect of this workflow, since it is more efficient to use purpose-made software for some tasks. Rather, it is intended to provide a straightforward and efficient processing pipeline to enable ecological analyses based on acoustic data.


Basic usage
-----------
.. admonition:: Pay attention to your environment

	If you installed pycnet-audio in a Conda environment, you'll need to run the tool with the appropriate environment active, denoted by the ``(pycnet)`` active environment indicator at the start of the prompt. If it isn't there, activate the environment by running 
	:: 

		conda activate pycnet

The command-line tools provided by pycnet-audio can be run from a shell program like the Anaconda Prompt, Windows PowerShell, bash, etc. You run the tool by invoking the ``pycnet`` command followed by a set of `arguments`. The basic usage will look something like this:
::

	pycnet process F:\COA_23459 -c v4
	
Here we are supplying three arguments:

- ``process`` is the `mode` that we are running pycnet in. This tells pycnet what we want to do - in this case, we want to run through the full processing pipeline outlined above.
- ``F:\COA_23459`` is the `target directory`, the path to a folder on our computer which contains the data we want to process.
- ``-c v4`` is an `optional argument` which includes a `flag`, ``-c``, and a `value`, ``v4``. In this case we are telling pycnet that we want to use version 4 of the PNW-Cnet model to generate class scores.

What actually happens when we run this command? Quite a lot, as it turns out:

1. pycnet searches the directory tree rooted at ``F:\COA_23459`` for files with a .wav extension. Every .wav file found is added to a table which keeps track of the file's location (relative to F:\COA_23459), name, size, and duration. This table is written to a file called ``COA_23459_wav_inventory.csv`` in the target directory.
2. pycnet creates a folder called ``Temp`` under ``F:\COA_23459``. This folder contains a subfolder called ``images``, which in turn contains one or more subfolders called ``Part_01``, ``Part_02``, etc., depending on the total duration of the audio data.
#. pycnet begins generating spectrograms representing non-overlapping 12-second segments of the audio in the frequency range 0-4000 Hz and saving them as image files. Images are saved in PNG format in the ``Temp\images\Part_xx`` folders.
#. pycnet loads the trained PNW-Cnet v4 model and begins feeding it batches of image data from the spectrograms that have just been generated. For each image, the model generates a set of 51 class scores, one for each of the target classes included in this version of the model. The names of the images and their corresponding class scores are placed in a table, which is saved to a file called ``COA_23459_v4_class_scores.csv`` in the target directory.
#. pycnet builds a table of counts of apparent detections for all target classes across a range of score thresholds based on the class score table. The count values represent the number of rows in the class score table where the score for each class exceeded the threshold. These counts are summed for each unique combination of site, recording station, date, and score threshold.
#. pycnet searches for apparent target class detections to be reviewed manually. Because we did not provide a review settings, the clips to be reviewed will be based on the default review criteria, i.e., rows where the score for either of the northern spotted owl classes (STOC and STOC_IRREG) was >= 0.25, or where the score for at least one other class was >= 0.95. pycnet places these detections in a table that is formatted to be browsable using Wildlife Acoustics, Inc.'s Kaleidoscope software. This table is then saved to a file called ``COA_23459_review_kscope.csv`` in the target directory.


Phew! As you can see, pycnet is capable of running through a fairly involved workflow without much input from the user. However, you can tailor the processing operation extensively to fit your needs by providing various command-line arguments. These arguments are essentially a formal syntax for telling pycnet what you actually want to do. The following sections describe the required and optional arguments in more detail.


Required arguments
------------------

Mode
++++

When you run the ``pycnet`` command, you almost always need to supply a mode and a target directory, in that order. Again, the **mode** is a single lowercase word that indicates what you want pycnet to do. 

Here is the full list of acceptable modes and what each of them does:

	``process`` 
		Inventory the audio files; generate spectrograms; generate class scores; summarize apparent detections; and generate the review file. This is intended to be the "bread-and-butter" option for normal data processing.

	``spectro`` 
		Inventory the audio files (if necessary) and generate the spectrograms.

	``predict`` 
		Generate class scores from an existing set of spectrograms; summarize apparent detections; and generate the review file. Useful if you want to process the same data with multiple versions of the PNW-Cnet model.

	``review`` 
		Summarize apparent detections from an existing set of class scores and generate a review file. Useful if you want to experiment with different review settings.

	``inventory`` 
		Inventory the audio files and write the information to a CSV file.

	``rename`` 
		Standardize filenames to the format expected by the program, consisting of a prefix (either supplied by the user or based on the directory structure) and the date and time when the recording began.

	``cleanup`` 
		Recursively delete the spectrograms and the temporary folder in which they were generated. (This can also be done automatically in some other modes by including the **-a** flag; see below.)

Target directory
++++++++++++++++

The **target directory** can be any folder on your computer, although if the folder doesn't contain any audio data, then pycnet will not be able to do much with it. 

You need to supply the target directory in the form of an `absolute path`. On a Windows machine this means it needs to include a drive letter and any intermediate directories in addition to the name of the folder itself. If you are viewing the folder in File Explorer, you can click on the address bar near the top of the window to highlight and copy the full path. You can also hold ``Shift`` and right-click on a folder in the File Explorer main pane and select ``Copy as path`` to copy the absolute path to the item.

pycnet will search the target directory for audio files with a .wav extension. This search is recursive, so .wav files contained in subfolders will also be found. However, we recommend keeping the directory structure simple and obvious, with a folder for each recording station containing the .wav files for that station, and a folder for each field site containing the folders for the recording stations at that site, e.g.
::

	F:/
	|__ COA_23459
		|___ Stn_A
			|_____ COA_23459-A_20230608_121502.wav
			|_____ COA_23459-A_20230608_130002.wav
			|_____ COA_23459-A_20230608_140002.wav
			|_____ COA_23459-A_20230608_150002.wav
						...
			|_____ COA_23459-A_20230723_084102.wav
		
		|___ Stn_B
			|_____ COA_23459-B_20230608_132709.wav
						...
			...

.. Important::
	pycnet expects the names of your .wav files to adhere to a specific format, which includes a study area or project code, field site ID, recording station ID, date and time. To wit::

		[Study Area]_[Site ID]-[Station ID]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav

	This format means that the name of each .wav file includes information on where and when the recording was made, ordered from most general to most specific. For instance, if we see a file named ``COA_23459-A_20230608_121502.wav``, then we know that it was recorded in the Oregon Coast Range (COA) study area, at site 23459, recording station A, and that the recording began on Jun 8, 2023, starting at 12:15:02 PM.
	
	**If your filenames do not adhere to this format, we cannot guarantee that all functions will work correctly.**


In addition to the above advice on filename formatting, we strongly recommend that you avoid using spaces in the names of your files and folders, as this can introduce various unintended behavior when processing data; underscores are a safe alternative. If you want to process data in a location whose path includes spaces, then you will need to enclose the target directory argument in double quotes when calling pycnet, e.g.
::

	pycnet process "F:\2024 ARU Data\KLA_16408"

This tells the interpreter to treat the text within the quotes as a single value rather than splitting the text at the spaces and treating each component as a separate value. The Windows "Copy as path" option described above will automatically add quotes around the path. (Paths that don't contain spaces do not need to be enclosed in quotes, but it won't hurt anything if you do.)

Optional arguments
------------------

In addition to the processing mode and the target directory, which are required, you can specify a number of other, optional arguments, which can be used in any order. In most cases you use these by including a flag followed by a value, e.g. ``-c v4``, somewhat like assigning a value to a variable. However, a few flags (``-a``, ``-l``, and ``-q``) can be used without specifying an additional value. In these cases, the flag itself acts as a switch that turns specific behaviors on or off.

The available optional arguments are as follows:

 ``-h`` (Help)
	Prints a summary of the available options and exits. This option is a special case, as it can be used without specifying a mode or target directory.
	
 ``-a`` (Auto-cleanup)
	Recursively delete the temporary folder that was created to hold the spectrogram image files once processing is complete. This flag does not need to be paired with a value.
 
 ``-c`` (Cnet version)
	The version of the PNW-Cnet model to use when generating class scores. Options: "v4" or "v5". Default: v5.
 
 ``-i`` (Image directory) 
	Allows you to specify a location where the temporary spectrogram directory should be created. If not provided, the spectrograms will be generated in a folder called Temp within the target directory. This can improve processing speed, e.g. generating spectrograms in a folder on a solid-state drive will allow you to take advantage of the SSD's higher read and write speeds.
 
 ``-l`` (Log output to file)
	Tell pycnet to copy output messages to a file in the target directory, in addition to displaying them in the console. This flag does not need to be paired with a value. 
 
 ``-o`` (Output file)
	Specify a name to be used for the review file instead of the default name. Useful if you want to experiment with different review settings without overwriting a previously generated file.
 
 ``-p`` (Prefix)
	Use a specific prefix when renaming files rather than generating the prefix automatically based on folder structure.
 
 ``-q`` (Quiet mode)
	Suppress progress bars when generating spectrograms and class scores. This flag does not need to be paired with a value.
 
 ``-r`` (Review settings)	
	You can specify review criteria in two different ways. First, you can supply the path to a CSV file specifying criteria to use when generating the review file. The file provided must have a column called "Class" listing the codes of the classes that you want included and another column called "Threshold" listing the score threshold (a decimal value between 0 and 1) to use to define apparent detections for each class. Alternatively, you can supply a text string consisting of class codes (or groups of class codes) followed by the score threshold to use for each class or group of classes, e.g. ``"STOC_4Note 0.50 STOC_Series Strix_Whistle 0.75"`` (the string must be enclosed in quotes, since it includes spaces).
 
 ``-w`` (Worker processes)
	Number of worker processes to use when generating spectrograms. By default, pycnet will use the number of logical CPU cores on your machine, as this is typically the fastest option. Specify a lower number if you want to reserve some CPU power for other tasks. Note that processing speed can be affected by other factors, e.g. the read and write speeds of the drives involved, so using more worker processes is not always faster.

Note that most of these options only make sense to use in certain modes. For instance, there is no reason to specify ``-c v4`` when running ``pycnet spectro`` because the PNW-Cnet model is not involved in generating spectrograms. Additionally, some options have a limited range of useful values. For instance, the ``-w`` flag can only usefully be set to a whole number between 1 and the number of logical cores in your machine's CPU. Generally, if you provide an option that is irrelevant for the processing mode you've chosen, it will be silently ignored. If the option is relevant but the value you provided cannot be used, pycnet will typically override your choice and use some default value instead.


More examples
-------------

.. note::

	If you want to practice using pycnet and don't have audio data of your own to work with, there is a small (10.5 hour) test audio dataset available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/7849426.

It may be helpful to see some additional examples of processing data using pycnet. Let's say I have some audio data located in a folder on an external hard drive, which has drive letter D. The path to the folder is ``D:\CLE_36702``. I want to generate the spectrograms in a folder on my solid-state drive, which has drive letter G. I want to do some other work while the process is running, so I don't want to use all available CPU cores. I could run
::

	pycnet process D:\CLE_36702 -w 8 -i G:\spectrograms -r F:\review_settings.csv -a

- ``pycnet process D:\CLE_36702`` means I want to run through the full processing pipeline with the audio data in this folder.
- ``-w 8`` means I want to use 8 worker processes when generating spectrograms. My machine has 16 logical cores, so this works fine.
- ``-i G:\spectrograms`` means the spectrogram image files will be generated in a folder located at ``G:\spectrograms\CLE_36702``. The ``G:\spectrograms`` folder will be created if it doesn't already exist.
- ``-a`` means the folder at ``G:\spectrograms\CLE_36702`` will be deleted once the class scores, detection summary file, and review file have been generated. (The ``G:\spectrograms`` folder will not be deleted.)
- ``-r F:\review_settings.csv`` means that when generating the review file, pycnet will only include target classes listed in ``F:\review_settings.csv`` and will use the score thresholds listed in the file to define apparent detections of each of these classes. The file provided should be formatted like so:

	+-------------+-----------+
	| Class       | Threshold |
	+=============+===========+
	| STOC_4Note  | 0.50      |
	+-------------+-----------+
	| STVA_8Note  | 0.95      |
	+-------------+-----------+
	| BRMA1       | 0.95      |
	+-------------+-----------+

There must be a column called ``Class`` listing the target classes to be included and another column called ``Threshold`` giving the score threshold to use for each class. If the file has any additional columns (e.g. for notes, common names, etc), they will be ignored. Note that pycnet will search for apparent detections for each of these classes in the order they are listed in the ``Class`` column, and a given clip can only appear once in the review file. For instance, if a clip has a score of 0.81 for the ``STOC_4Note`` class and a score of 0.98 for the ``STVA_8Note`` class, it will be included in the review file with ``STOC_4Note`` in the ``TOP1MATCH`` column, even though it scored higher for ``STVA_8Note``. (However, the ``AUTO_TAG`` column will read ``STOC_4Note+STVA_8Note`` to indicate that it met the threshold for both classes.)

Appendix A. Output files
========================

Depending on the mode chosen, pycnet may generate one or more output files when you process data. These will all be in the form of comma-separated value (CSV) files, and they will all be saved in the target directory you provided. CSV files can be opened in a spreadsheet program like Excel or a text editor like Notepad, or imported as a table using a statistical program like R. The names of these files will include the name of the target directory (just the folder name, not the full path) and, in most cases, the version of PNW-Cnet used (either 'v5' or 'v4'). As an example, let's say I have data in a folder called CLE_36702 that I have processed with PNW-Cnet version 5. The output files would be as follows:

CLE_36702_wav_inventory.csv
	Lists all files with a .wav extension found in the directory rooted at CLE_36702. Fields in this file are as follows:
	
		Folder
			Location of the file relative to CLE_36702.
		Filename
			Name of the .wav file.
		Size
			Size of the file in bytes.
		Duration
			Duration of the recording in seconds.

CLE_36702_v5_class_scores.csv
	Lists the class scores generated by PNW-Cnet v5 for the set of spectrograms generated from the .wav files listed in CLE_36702_wav_inventory.csv. Fields in this file are as follows: 
	
		Filename
			Name of each spectrogram image file. 
		[ACCO1, ACGE1, ..., ZOLE1] 
			Class scores for each of the 135 PNW-Cnet v5 target classes for each image. Each class score is a decimal value in the range [0,1]. Higher class scores indicate a stronger match. If the class scores were generated using PNW-Cnet v4 then there will instead be 51 class score columns [AEAC, BRCA, ..., ZEMA], but the structure will be the same.
	
CLE_36702_v5_detection_summary.csv
	Lists the number of apparent detections for all PNW-Cnet v5 target classes across a range of thresholds [0.05, 0.10, ..., 0.95, 0.98, 0.99], summed for each combination of site, recording station, and recording date. Fields in this file are as follows:
	
		Area
			Study area ID. First component of the .wav filenames; in this case CLE.
		Site
			Field site ID. Second component of the .wav filenames; in this case 36702.
		Stn
			Recording station ID. Third component of the .wav filenames.
		Date
			Calendar date.
		Rec_Day
			Sequential day of recording at this site, equal to ``Date - min(Date) + 1``.
		Rec_Week
			Sequential week of recording at this site, equal to ``int(Rec_Day / 7) + 1``.
		Clips
			Number of 12-second clips in the class_scores file for this combination of Area, Site, Stn, and Date.
		Effort
			Hours of recording for this combination of Area, Site, Stn, and Date, equal to ``Clips / 300.``.
		Threshold
			Score threshold used to tally apparent detections.
		[ACCO1, ACGE1, ..., ZOLE1]
			Number of apparent detections (i.e., the number of Clips with score >= Threshold) for each of the 135 PNW-Cnet v5 target classes for this combination of Area, Site, Stn, and Date. If the class scores were generated using PNW-Cnet v4 then there will instead be 51 columns [AEAC, BRCA, ..., ZEMA], but the structure will be the same.

CLE_36702_v5_review_kscope.csv
	Lists apparent detections for classes included in the review settings dictionary. Fields in this file are as follows:
		
		FOLDER
			Location of the file relative to CLE_36702.
			
		IN_FILE
			Source file, i.e., the long-form .wav file containing the clip.
		
		PART
			Sequential 12-second segment of IN_FILE.
		
		CHANNEL
			Channel of the audio. Always 1.
		
		OFFSET
			Location of the clip within IN_FILE in seconds.
		
		DURATION
			Length of the clip in seconds.
		
		DATE
			Calendar date at the beginning of the clip. May differ from the timestamp in the IN_FILE filename if that recording went past midnight.
		
		TIME
			Time at the beginning of the clip.
		
		OFFSET_MMSS
			Location of the clip within IN_FILE in human-readable units.
		
		TOP1MATCH
			The *first* class listed in the review settings dictionary for which the clip exceeded the corresponding score threshold. Each clip will only appear once in the review file, even if it met the threshold for multiple target classes, and the value in TOP1MATCH is not necessarily the class to which PNW-Cnet assigned the highest score for this clip. The AUTO_TAG field 
		
		TOP1DIST
			Class score assigned to the clip by PNW-Cnet for the class in TOP1MATCH. Again, this is not necessarily the highest class score for the clip in question, since TOP1MATCH partly depends on the order that classes are listing in the review settings dictionary.
		
		THRESHOLD
			Threshold used to define apparent detections for the class in TOP1MATCH.
		
		SORT
			Concatenation of TOP1MATCH, FOLDER, and sequential week of recording for this site. Used for more convenient sorting of the review_kscope file when reviewing detections.
		
		AUTO_TAG
			Concatenation of all classes listed in the review settings dictionary for which the clip met the threshold, in alphabetical order.
		
		VOCALIZATIONS
			Dummy column, possibly unnecessary. Value is always 1.
		
		MANUAL_ID
			Column to hold species IDs and other tags added manually in Kaleidoscope. Always blank when the file is created. If you plan to tag the review file manually, we recommend saving it under a different filename (e.g. ``CLE_36702_review_kscope_TAGGED.csv``) to avoid the possibility of accidentally overwriting the tags you have applied.


Appendix B. PNW-Cnet target classes
===================================

The following table lists the target classes (sonotypes) detected by versions v4 and v5 of the PNW-Cnet model. The 'v4_Code' and 'v5_Code' columns list the abbreviated class codes which are used as column headers for columns containing class scores in the PNW-Cnet prediction files. All classes that were included in PNW-Cnet v4 were subsequently also included in PNW-Cnet v5, but the class codes were updated between versions to reflect more consistent naming conventions.
